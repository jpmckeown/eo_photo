Photos for Country Data Map Project
 
We are trying to compile data and images on every country to demonstrate either its progress or lack thereof toward achieving sustainability. One area we need help with is the gathering of 3-5 photos for each country. The photos should ideally represent, in part, the most important information presented. 
 
For instance, if the country is Afghanistan and we mention that girls do not receive adequate quality or duration of education we could have a photo of Afghani girls. If the information indicates that there is terrible air pollution in the entry for Hungary, we could have a photo of the haze that hangs in the air over a city. 
 
The sticking point and something we'd like you to look into is whether there are enough quality photos that we can use without licensing them. That would mean we want photos that when you search fall under "Creative Commons" license not Commercial license.

For each photo include source (link) and caption as to what it represents. Have at least one photo of a person or people from the county. Refer to comments on Country Data Spread Sheet under the column “Actual Comment for Website” for more information/context of photos that could align with the comments.
